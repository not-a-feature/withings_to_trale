# Withings to Trale
[Trale](https://github.com/QuantumPhysique/trale) is a  "simple body-weight diary app [that respects] your privacy".


If you're using [Withings](https://withings.com/) to track your weight but want to switch to a free and open-source alternative, you can switch to [Trale](https://github.com/QuantumPhysique/trale).
This tool converts your old weight data from the data export to a format Trale can import. 

Try it out here: https://not-a-feature.github.io/withings_to_trale/ 

- It's fully local, so no data is transmitted.
- Download and open your exported archive.
- Select the "weight.csv" and open it using this page.
- Finally, download the new file and import it using the button in the Trale settings.
